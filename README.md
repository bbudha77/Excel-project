# Budgeting Project Overview

This project is a personal budgeting template that I created to practice Excel skills like formula and data visualisation. It includes income, expense and savings tracking, along with charts to analyze financial patterns. Below is a breakdown of the project and how I used Excel features to build it.

# Project Structure

## 1. Income and Expenses Summary
The project starts with a detailed breakdown of income and expenses. The tables provide a clear view of where money is coming from and where it is being spent.

## 2. Savings Summary
A significant portion of the income is saved, indicating a focus on financial security. The savings are categorized, and percentages show the proportion of income saved versus spent.

## 3. Income and Expense Breakdowns
These tables provide further details on different income brackets and expense categories, helping to understand the distribution of finances more granularly.

# Visualizations

## Donut Chart
A donut chart can be used to visualize the proportion of income saved versus expenses. For example:

Savings (52%): Represented by one segment of the donut.

Expenses (48%): Represented by the other segment.

This visualization helps quickly grasp the balance between savings and expenditures.

## Inverted Pyramid
An inverted pyramid can illustrate the hierarchy of expenses. For example:

Base (Largest Expense): Rent ($30,000)

Middle Layers: Insurance (15000), Groceries(10,000), Transportation ($6,000)

Top (Smallest Expenses): Eating out(2,000),  Internet and phones(1000)

This visualization shows how expenses are prioritized and where the bulk of the money is going.

## Bar Chart
A bar chart can be used to compare different categories of income and expenses side by side. For example:

Income Categories: Salary, Bonus, Other Income, etc.

Expense Categories: Rent, Insurance, Transportation, etc.

This chart provides a clear comparison of different financial categories, making it easy to see which areas are the most significant.

# Why This Project?

## Excel Skills Practiced
- Formulas( SUM, percentage calculations).
- Chart customization( donut bar, pyramid)
  
 ## Real World Relevance
  Budgeting helps understand personal finance, and visualizing data makes patterns easier to spot.

  # Conclusions
  This project was a valuable exercise in matering basic excel skills and building foundational knowledge in excel. Moreover, having hands on budgeting was equally important to understand personal finances.
